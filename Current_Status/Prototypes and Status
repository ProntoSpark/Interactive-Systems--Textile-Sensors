# PROJECT_CURRENT_STATUS

## PROTOTYPE  I

Battery and LEDs have been purchased to display the output.
	Upper and lower conductive layers with resistive layer in between are formed by sewing them together. This is the first prototype without have additional sensitivity integrated
	Testing the first prototype with LEDs.

## PROTOTYPE II

Trying  sensitivity with copper conductive thread and testing the output. The copper conductive thread is embedded and sewed in sensing areas and then tested.

## PROTOTYPE III

Trying  more sensitivity with thick copper strips and testing the output. The copper tapes are embedded and sewed in sensing areas and then tested.
