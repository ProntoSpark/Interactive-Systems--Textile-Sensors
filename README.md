# PROJECT: INTELLIGENT TEXTILES- PIEZORESISTIVE SOFT & STRETCHABLE PRESSURE SENSORS
## MOTIVATION

According to Mark Weiser (Father of Ubiquitous Computing), we must take the human world into consideration and make computing/computers/devices disappear and vanish into human world. 
One such area of Ubiquitous Computing would be the e-textiles, which lets us weave computing into our textile and wearable. 
As a result we would be able to use the devices with ease, i.e forget their existence as they become a part of us and our lives.

## OBJECTIVES

The project is aimed at building a basic and multipurpose pressure sensor which holds Piezoresitivity principle as base. 
The textile pressure sensor is incorporated with relevant features like Softness, High Stretchability, Precise Sensitivity in the sensing defined areas.
This pressure sensor would be able to sense and detect the amount of external force/strain applied on textiles which could be in the form of pressure, stretch, twist etc

## HIGHLIGHTS

While most of the pressure sensors today are built using Arduino controller, our sensor is built without a Arduino, but with basic, ecofriendly and costfriendly supplies.

### IMPROVEMENT - SENSITIVITY OF SENSOR

Since we have not used controller for sensing, we have made the sensing area more sensitive by sewing silver/copper tape/ conductive thread over the conductive fabric which is the mainhighlight of the project.

## SENSOR SETUP
### SENSOR LAYERS

This sensor consists of 3 layers.
 	1.Upper and lower layers  are the conductive fabric.
	2.The middle resistive layer-velostat would be embedded between the conductive layers.
	3.Copper tapes could be surfaced on conductive layers for high conductivity.
	4.The above layers which forms our sensor is stitched/embedded within our cloth fabric, which we would wear.
  
A multimeter would then be used to measure the amount of pressure imposed on the sensor and LED for output.
The entire sensor setup is then be integrated to the 15*15cm wooden frame for demo purpose

### SENSOR MAKING

#### The STORY BOARD of Sensor Making is under Sketches and Prototype folder

Conductive fabric is either woven by hand or taken as ready made according to the level of elasticity required. 
Since the sensor is a wearable sensor, the elasticity level is decided according to the commercial purpose and then the conductive stretchable fabric is made accordingly.
Each of 2 pieces of conductive fabric (stretchable or non stretchable according to use and need) which is cut in shape of square with long leads (to connect to the LEDs) is sewed to each of cloth fabric pieces (which we wear).
Resistive velostat material is woven with the help of conductive thread within these conductive fabrics to form the pressure sensor. The cloth fabric pieces are now stitched from outside. Now a very basic sensor is ready.
As specified in highlights, the projects' main target and improvement lies in improving the sensitivity of the sensing area. This is done by sewing silver/copper tapes/ conductive thread over the sensing area. Before stitching the cloth fabrics together, the aforementioned step should be done and tested.
This sensor can be interacted in 2 ways: i) By pressing ii) By twisting III) By stretching.
Tests and Prototypes with images are available under the Prototype folder

### Simple Working Principle behind this Pressure Sensor

Basic principle is that the change in resistance of the conductive material implies about the amount of external force/strain. 
According to the band theory of semiconductors and conductors, the valence electrons reside in the valence band and charge carriers (positive (holes) and negative) reside in the conduction band (unoccupied for conduction band, only holes).
When an external force is applied on the material, the electrons from the valence band acquires sufficient energy and is hit to the conduction band, thereby disturbing the pre-positioned structural spacing of electrons (which are responsible for resistance). 
Due to the electron shift in the bands, change in resistance occurs, contributing to conductivity.
The change in the position of electrons between the energy bands, which are triggered by external energy(twist, pressure, stretch etc) are responsible for conduction. 
The more the strain, more is the change in structure of electrons which is change in resistance, contributing to the conductivity.
